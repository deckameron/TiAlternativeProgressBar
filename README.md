Usage
-----

If you want to understand what `secondary` actually means or if you want to see it in action,
in `example/app.js` youâ€™ll find a complete example. The following one only acts as a reference.

```js
var AlternateProgressBar = require('it.smc.alternativeprogressbar');

var progressbar = AlternateProgressBar.createProgressBar({
    min: 0,
    max: 100,
    value: 42,
    secondary: 49,
    indeterminate: true // set to false (default) to show an actual progress
});
```
