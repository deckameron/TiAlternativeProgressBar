## Accessing the TiAlternativeProgressBar Module
----------------
To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:

	var AlternativeProgressBar = require('it.smc.alternativeprogressbar');

The AlternativeProgressBar is a reference to the Module object.

## Usage
--------

###Properties

- ``min :``	 *number*,	minimum value of the progress bar.
- ``max :``	 *number*,	maximum value of the progress bar.
- ``value :``	 *number*, 	main progress line value.
- ``secondary :``	 *number*,	sub-progress line value.
- ``indeterminate :``	 *boolean*,	set to false (default) to show an actual progress.

If you want to understand what `secondary` actually means or if you want to see it in action,
in `example/app.js` youâ€™ll find a complete example. The following one only acts as a reference.

```js
var AlternativeProgressBar = require('it.smc.alternativeprogressbar');

var progressbar = AlternativeProgressBar.createProgressBar({
	top: '-26dip',
    min: 0,
    max: 100,
    value: 42,
    secondary: 49,
    indeterminate: true 
});
```	
###Please pay attention :


In this first release, to make the *Progress Bar* stick to the *Action Bar*, we set the **" top "** property to a magic number in dip, which is **" -26 "** .
